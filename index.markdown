Hi, I'm Alex! Currently I'm in the process of transitioning from academic to ML engineering--check out some of my projects on Github. 

I recently wrapped up my PhD in mathematics at Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Francesco Lin. During my PhD, I worked on low dimensional topology and gauge theory, specifically the Seiberg--Witten equations and their interactions with Einstein metrics. Before that, I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara, and did my undergrad thesis under the supervision of Prof. Xianzhe Dai.
