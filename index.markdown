Hi, I'm Alex! Currently I'm in the process of transitioning from academic to ML engineering--check out some of my projects on Github. 

I recently wrapped up my PhD in mathematics at Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Francesco Lin. During my PhD, I worked on low dimensional topology, differential geometry, and gauge theory. Specifically, I thought about the Seiberg--Witten equations and their interactions with Einstein metrics. Before that, I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara, and did my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Prof. Xianzhe Dai. 

Outside of work, I enjoy bouldering, brewing specialty coffee and tea, baking bread, and cooking. I also enjoy playing Pokemon Go. 

If you want to contact me, send an email to axu930 (at) gmail.com and Iâ€™ll do my best to get back to you. In the meatime, feel free to check out my resume below. Or view it as a [PDF](/assets/Alex_Xu_CV_2025.pdf).
