Hi, I'm Alex! Currently I'm in the process of transitioning from academic to ML engineering--check out some of my projects on Github. 

I recently wrapped up my PhD in mathematics at Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Francesco Lin. During my PhD, I worked on low dimensional topology, differential geometry, and gauge theory. Specifically, I thought about the Seiberg--Witten equations and their interactions with Einstein metrics. Before that, I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara, and did my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Prof. Xianzhe Dai. 

Outside of work, I enjoy bouldering, brewing specialty coffee and tea, baking bread, and cooking. 

If you want to contact me, send an email to axu930 (at) gmail.com and I’ll do my best to get back to you. In the meatime, feel free to check out my [resume](/assets/resume2025.pdf) below:
