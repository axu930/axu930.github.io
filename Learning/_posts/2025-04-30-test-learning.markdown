# Test Header
Learning template post. This is where I plan to document papers that I've read and things I've learned. The goal will be to read some collection of papers and blog posts and give an overview of the landscape for something (ML, stats, math, etc.). Hopefully someone will find this useful. 

## Test Subheader
Test of math capabilities $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$ inline math, and

$$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \infty $$

for centered math.

## Test Subheader 2 
Code 

```Python
print("Hello World")
```
