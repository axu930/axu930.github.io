# Test Header
Project template post. This is where I plan to document personal projects that I'm working on (code or otherwise), including motivations as well as troubleshooting to help me have something to do when I get stuck or bored. Hopefully this helps people try similar things of their own. 

## Test Subheader
Test of math capabilities: $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$ inline math, and

$$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \infty $$

for centered math.

Testing code blocks 

{% highlight python %}
x = "Hello World"
print("x")
# Hello World
{% endhighlight %}
