# Test Header
Test project post. This is where I plan to document personal projects that I'm working on (code or otherwise), including motivations as well as troubleshooting to help me have something to do when I get stuck or bored. Hopefully this helps people try similar things of their own. 

## Test Subheader
Test of math capabilities $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$  inline math, and

$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \infty$$

for centered math.
